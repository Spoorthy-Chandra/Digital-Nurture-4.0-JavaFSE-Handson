Big O Notation:
->Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm’s running time as input size grows.
->It helps compare the efficiency of algorithms regardless of machine or language.

Time Complexities in Search:
Scenario	        Linear Search	        Binary Search
Best-case	        O(1) (first match)	  O(1) (middle match)
Average	          O(n/2) → O(n)	        O(log n)
Worst-case	      O(n)	                O(log n)

Note: Binary search only works on sorted data.
