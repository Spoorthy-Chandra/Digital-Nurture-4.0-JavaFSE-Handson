->Time Complexity:
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) â†’ Time complexity is O(n) (linear).

->Optimization Tip:
While the recursion here is not deeply nested (and tail recursion can be optimized by the compiler in some languages), 
we can also write it using iteration or memoization if performance is a concern in more complex scenarios.
