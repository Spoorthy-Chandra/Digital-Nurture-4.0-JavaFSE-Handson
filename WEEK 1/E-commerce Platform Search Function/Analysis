Time Complexity:
Linear Search: O(n) – checks each product one by one
Binary Search: O(log n) – much faster but requires sorting first

->Use Linear Search for small datasets or unsorted data.
->Use Binary Search for large datasets that are pre-sorted or can be sorted once.
->For an e-commerce platform with thousands of products, use binary search with sorted product lists or a proper indexing system (like HashMap or a database index) for fast lookup.
